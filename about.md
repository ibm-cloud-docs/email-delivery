# About email delivery

{{site.data.keyword.SendGrid}}, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} email delivery service, is a mail relay service that allows you to use a smart host to relay your outbound mail services. A smart host relays SMTP traffic from an SMTP server, mail client, or any other service or programming language capable of handling SMTP. This service also generates metrics, tracks email lists, and tracks email activity such as bounced, clicked, dropped, and opened emails. There are other features of this service such as newsletter assistance and authentication.
